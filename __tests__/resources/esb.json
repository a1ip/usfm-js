The most common fish in the Lake\nof Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of Moses allowed people to eat any fish with\nfins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to\nbe eaten (\\xt Lev 11.9-12\\xt*). Fish were also probably brought from Tyre and Sidon,\nwhere they were dried and salted.\n...\n\\p Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because the Greek\nword for fish (\\tl ichthus\\tl*) consists of the first letters of the Greek words that\ntell who Jesus is: \\fig Christian Fish Image|christfish.jpg||||Ihsous Christos Theou\nUios Swthr|\\fig*\n",
